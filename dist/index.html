            <p><id><strong>One piece</strong>  (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 101 tankōbon volumes as of December 2021. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.
             The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production I.G, and an  series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.
             One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many  and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its 100 published tankōbon volumes.
             As of July 2021, One Piece had over 490 million copies in circulation in 58 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. It is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. </p>

                       The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, whom, inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,<a href="#1" ><sup>[Jp 1]</sup></a> Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a perverted but chivalrous chef. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry,<a href="#2" ><sup>[Jp 2]</sup></a> and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archae                                        ologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship, the Thousand Sunny,<a href="#3" ><sup>[Jp 3]</sup></a> built by Franky. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.

                        <h4> Geography </h4>
                        <p >
                                        The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as fish-men and merfolk (two races of fish/human hybrids), dwarves, minks (a race of humanoids with animal features), and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line,<a href="#4" ><sup>[Jp 4]</sup></a> which is also the only continent in the world.[2] The Grand Line,<a href="#1" ><sup>[Jp 5]</sup></a> a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue,<a href="#6" ><sup>[Jp 6]</sup></a></sup>> East Blue,<a href="#7" ><sup>[Jp 7]</sup></a>West Blue,<a href="#8" ><sup>[Jp 8]</sup></a> and South Blue.<a href="#9" ><sup>[Jp 9]</sup></a><a href="#3" ><sup>[Jp 3]</sup></a>> Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts,<a href="#10" ><sup>[Jp 10]</sup></a> similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings.<a href="#11" ><sup>[Jp 11]</sup></a> Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line.<a href="#4" ><sup>[Jp 4]</sup></a> However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone<a href="#12" ><sup>[Jp 12]</sup></a> to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain.<a href="#13"  ><sup>[Jp 13]</sup></a> Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half.<a href="#6" ><sup>[Jp 6]</sup></a> The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.<a href="#4"  ><sup>[Jp 4]</sup></a><a href="#17" ><sup>[Jp 17]</sup></a>
            
                                        The currents and weather of the Grand Line's open sea are extremely unpredictable, whereas in the vicinity of islands the climate is stable.<a href="#8" ><sup>[Jp 8]</sup></a>
                                         The magnetic fields within the Grand Line cause normal compasses to malfunction, making it even more difficult to navigate,<a href="#9" hfre="3" ><sup>[Jp 9][Jp3]</sup></a> and instead a special compass called a Log Pose<a href="#15" ><sup>[Jp 15]</sup></a></sup>> must be used.[10] The Log Pose functions by locking on to one island's magnetic field and then locking on to another island's magnetic field.<a href="#11" ><sup>[Jp 11]</sup></a> The time for it to set depends on the island.<a href="#12" ><sup>[Jp 12]</sup></a> This process can be bypassed by obtaining an Eternal Pose,<a href="#16" ><sup>[Jp 16]</sup></a> a Log Pose variation that is permanently set to a specific island and never changes.<a href="#13" ><sup>[Jp 13]</sup></a>
                                        
                                        The world of One Piece includes animals that function like devices. Transponder Snails<a href="#17" ><sup>[Jp 17]</sup></a> are snail-like animals that act like a rotary phone, fax machine, or camera.<a href="#14" ><sup>[Jp 14][Jp 15]</sup><a href="#15" ><sup>[Jp 15]</sup></a></a></sup> Dials,<a href="#18" ><sup>[Jp 18]</sup></a> the shells of certain sky-dwelling animals, can be used to store kinetic energy, wind, sound, images, heat, and the like and have various applications.
                        </p>
                                        <h3 id="105">Devil Fruits</h3>
                                        A Devil Fruit<a href="#19" ><sup>[Jp 19]</sup></a> is a type of fruit that, when eaten, grants a power to the eater.<a href="#17" ><sup>[Jp 17]</sup></a> A person may only eat one Devil Fruit during their lifetime, as eating a second Devil Fruit will swiftly end their life.<a href="#18" ><sup>[Jp 18]</sup></a> There are three categories of Devil Fruits;<a href="#19" ><sup>[Jp 19]</sup></a>
                                        Paramecia<a href="20" ><sup>[Jp 20]</sup></a> is a category of fruits that gives the user various superhuman abilities, such as Nico Robin's appendage generation or Brook's self-revival.<a href="#20" ><sup>[Jp 20]</sup></a>
                                        Zoan<a href="#21" ><sup>[Jp 21]</sup></a> fruits allo the user to fully or partially transform into a specific animal, like how Tony Tony Chopper can transform into a human-reindeer hybrid. Certain Zoan fruits allow the user to transform into prehistoric creatures, like X Drake being able to turn into an Allosaurus, and even mythical creatures, like how Marco can transform into a phoenix. Through an unknown technique developed by scientist Dr. Vegapunk, inanimate objects can also "eat" a Devil Fruit and gain sentience, like how Spandam's sword become an elephant.<a href="#21" ><sup>[Jp 21]</sup></a>
                                        Logia<a href="#22" ><sup>[Jp 22]</sup></a> fruits give control over and allow the user "to change their living body structure into the powers of nature", like Smoker's control over smoke, Portgas D. Ace's control over fire, and Sir Crocodile's control over sand.<a href="#19" ><sup>[Jp 19]</sup></a>
                                        Devil Fruits are said to be incarnations of the sea devil himself and as a result, Devil Fruit users cannot swim in sea water as "they are hated by the sea".<a href="#22" ><sup>[Jp 22]</sup></a>> When even partially submerged in sea water, they lose all their strength and coordination, although some abilities remain. For example, Luffy is still able to stretch after being totally submerged. Sea-prism stone also has this effect. Moving water, such as rain or waves, does not have this effect. When a Devil Fruit user dies, the powers reincarnate into a new Devil Fruit. For unknown reasons, Devil Fruit users cannot eat a second Devil Fruit because it would cause their bodies to burst, although series antagonist Blackbeard manages to obtain a second Devil Fruit power through an unknown method. Devil Fruit powers can also be "awakened", greatly increasing the power and utility of the user's abilities.<a href="#23" ><sup>[Jp 23]</sup></a>
                                        There is also an artificial Devil Fruit created by Caesar Clown called the SMILE which enables the user to obtain the abilities of a specific animal, but having only partially a part of the animal such as the legs, ears, or the head protruding from any limb of the body, like the head of an animal in the stomach or in place of the hand, wings in the head or the waist, or an animal appearing in place of their legs.
                                        Haki
                                        Haki (覇気, lit. "Ambition") is a latent ability that every living being in the world of One Piece possesses; very few manage to awaken it, and even fewer master it. There are three varieties of Haki: Color of Observation (見聞色の覇気, Kenbunshoku no Haki) allows one to sense the presence of other beings and to have a form of limited precognition. Color of Arms (武装色の覇気, Busōshoku no Haki) allows one to envelop body parts and even inanimate objects with a force akin to an invisible armor that possesses defensive and offensive properties. It also allows one to inflict harm upon Logia-type Devil Fruit users. The rare Color of the Supreme King (覇王色の覇気, Haōshoku no Haki) is an ability that, unlike the other two Haki, only a few gifted people have. The Color of the Supreme King enables one to overpower the will of the weak-willed. It can be used to force others into submission or even render victims unconscious. Strong-willed people can withstand, or even completely ignore, the effects of this Haki, even if they do not possess the ability themselves. This Haki can also have physical impact, such as causing shock waves and destruction to the user's surroundings.<a href="#24" ><sup>[Jp 24]</sup></a>

                                  Eiichiro Oda's interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series Vicky the Viking, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.<a href="#25" ><sup>[Jp 25]</sup></a> The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in One Piece; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward "Blackbeard" Teach.<a href="#26" ><sup>[Jp 26]</sup></a> Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball, which is one of his favorite manga.<a href="#27" ><sup>[Jp 27]</sup></a> He was also inspired by The Wizard of Oz, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.<a href="#28" ><sup>[Jp 28]</sup></a>
                                  While working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing One Piece in 1996.<a href="#29" ><sup>[Jp 29]</sup></a> It started as two one-shot stories entitled Romance Dawn[29]—which would later be used as the title for One Piece's first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in Akamaru Jump and later in One Piece Red. The second was published in the 41st issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, Wanted!.<a href="#30" ><sup>[Jp 30]</sup></a> In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of One Piece, revealed that the manga was rejected by Weekly Shōnen Jump three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the series.<a href="#31" ><sup>[Jp 31]</sup></a>

                                <p id> When creating a Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.<a href="#32" ><sup>[Jp 32]</sup></a> The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters' techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is Onigiri, which is written as demon cut but is pronounced the same as rice ball in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they "might have cut down the laughs by about half".<a href="#33" ><sup>[Jp 33]</sup></a> Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators "made the anime pretty close to the manga".<a href="#33" ><sup>[Jp 33]</sup></a>
                                    Oda was "sensitive" about how his work would be translated.<a href="#34" ><sup>[Jp 34]</sup></a> In many instances, the English version of the One Piece manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, "saaa" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and "zaaa" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as "fshhhhhhh".<a href="#35" ><sup>[Jp 35]</sup></a> Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn. In this way, he wishes to maintain a uniform representation, leaving only the realization of the backgrounds to his staff, based on his sketches.<a href="#36" ><sup>[Jp 36]</sup></a> This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring.[37] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in One Piece since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love stories.<a href="#38" ><sup>[Jp 38]</sup></a>
